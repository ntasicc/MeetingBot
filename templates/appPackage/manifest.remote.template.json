The app can let members of a team join the queue under any name and will be called by an organizer when they are next in line. They can also form a group, join a group, see the order in a queue or even leave. As for the owners of a team created in MS Teams, they have wast control over the participants. The owners can notify the next team in line or maybe even the whole lobby, remove team or individual from a queue and prohibit the latecomers to attend a meeting.\nTo get started just add MeetingBot to your team and mention it in the created meeting. For a list of commands, you can type help and before executing the command you need to mention bot first."
